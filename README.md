This Program is designed to calculate the average scores of alx students.

It sums the scores of all projects average scores and divides them by the number of projects done to give you the overa+rall total scores.

So far, we have done 0-day, Low level programming, System engineering and algorithm as well as Evaluations and this is atotal of four (4) projects. The program collects the point for each projects, addsthem up and divides them by the total number of projects done. 

This program will receive constant updates as more projects will be given to us from ALX. The password is *11224*

Find below the instructions for how to run the codes on your pc.

## INSTRUCTION

*NOTE: It is passworded. Not because it has a virus but I set it that way for more interaction. It has no virus or corrupt files. I have had other students test it out and have gotten good feedbacks.*
