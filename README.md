This Program is designed to calculate the average scores of alx students, currently in cohort 10.

It sums the scores of all projects average scores and divides them by the number of projects done to give you the overall total scores.

So far, we have done 0-day, Low level programming, System engineering and algorithm as well as Evaluations and this is a total of four (4) projects. The program collects the point for each projects, adds them up and divides them by the total number of projects done.

This program will receive constant updates as more projects will be given to us from ALX. The password is *11224*

Find below the instructions for how to run the codes on your pc.

## INSTRUCTION
  - Download the .exe file named calx.
  - Save it on your desktop (for easy access).
  - Open your cmd or whatever terminal you use.
  - cd into your desktop (do this if you actually are following my instructions and the exe is on your desktop. If it is not there then cd into the path where you saved the exe).
  - And run the exe file with this operation `./calx` button and the code will run.

*NOTE: It is passworded. Not because it has a virus but I set it that way for more interaction. It has no virus or corrupt files. I have had other students test it out and have gotten good feedbacks.*

Kindly follow my GitHub for more projects. For my next project, I plan to design a Rock, Paper and Scissors game and Whot with C.If you are interested in joining me then send me a message via emmanuelmajor99@gmail.com
